# Babel-Solution

The JavaScript code in the provided index.js script populates the list of planets and applies some transformations to each planet's name before displaying it.

The transformations applied are:

planet |> sentenceCase: This transforms the planet name to start with an uppercase letter.

planetIcon: This adds the ðŸ’« emoji and a space in front of the planet name.
The resulting formatted planet names are then added to the <ul> list.

The data-presets="pipeline-op" attribute in the script tag indicates that the script should be processed using the pipeline operator plugin from Babel.
